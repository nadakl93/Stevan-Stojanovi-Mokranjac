<h1>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac</h1>

<p>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac (January 9, 1856–1914) was a Serbian composer and <br> music educator. His work was essential in bringing the spirit of Valach <br> Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art. </p>
<b>Biografy</b>
<p>He was born in Negotin. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second <br> last name Mokranjac (literally: resident of Mokranje).</p>
<p>He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science <br> and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade. In 1879 he traveled to <br> Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef Rheinberger. After a <br> brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the class of Parisotti, in <br> 1884. Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the <br> Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.</p>
<p>From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. Upon his return to <br> Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade singing society <br> (Belgrade Choir). From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high <br> school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija (Belgrade Theological College) <br> where he taught church singing. Together with Stanislav Binički and Cvetko <br> Manojlović, Mokranjac founded the first independent music school in 1899 - <br> Serbian Music School in Belgrade. He remains the director of this school <br> until his death. Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph <br> bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.</p>
<p>Stevan Mokranjac died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58.
</p>
<p>Every year, the town of Negotin organizes a music festival in his honor <br> called Mokranjčevi dani (Days of Mokranjac). The town also has a Mokranjac <br> museum.</p>
<b>Works</b>
<p>His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these <br> two types of music as inspiration for his work. His most famous pieces are <br> the fifteen Rukoveti (Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches") - a <br> collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) based on motives of Serbian <br> folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and <br> Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. His other prominent folk-based works <br> include Primorski napjevi (Coastland tunes), and Kozar.</p>
<p>A significant number of his works were made for church services. Such as the <br> Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog (The Divine Liturgy of St. <br> Chrysostom), from which the Heruvimska pesma (Cherubic hymn) is most famous. <br> Another two famous religious pieces are Tebe Boga hvalim (Te Deum) <br> and Veličanije Sv. Savi (Megalynarion to St. Sava).</p>
